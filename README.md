Feather
=========

Feather is an extremely lightweight publish-subscribe message broker (event bus). It supports both topic (through types) and content (through a predicate) based filtering. The goal of Feater P/S is to maximize message throughput.

<h2 name="features">Features</h2>

+ <strong>Asynchronous</strong> Everything can run asynchronously, as well as synchronously. Just provide an executor that does what you want.
+ <strong>Filters</strong> A simple yet flexible filter system. Every subscriber is fitered by types, and it is optionally filtered by a predicate. All you need to do is implement the PredicatedSubscriber class and the applies method.
+ <strong>Unread messages</strong> Catch any message that was not received by a subscriber just by creating a subscriber that listens for UnreadMessage.
+ <strong>Lightweight</strong> Feather is extremely lightweight and doesn't bring in any bloat, redundant concepts or confusing features.
+ <strong>Strategy based</strong> Allows you to provide strategies to specify how the broker does things. This allows you to optimize for different things by simply changing how you create the broker.
+ <strong>Fast</strong> Faster than other publish-subscribe frameworks by orders of magnitude. Check out the <a href="http://www.joepritzel.com/blog/publish-subscribe" target="_blank">case study</a>.

<h2 name="usage">Usage</h2>
How to create the publish-subscribe message broker and set up for use:
```Java
// Use a builder to create a new PSBroker.
// The build allows you to provide customizable strategies for the broker to use.
PSBroker broker = new PSBrokerBuilder().build();
```  
Example of how to create a subscriber:
```Java
public class UnreadMessageReader extends Subscriber<UnreadMessage> {
	@Override
	public void receive(UnreadMessage message) {
		// insert logic here
	}
}
```
Example of how to let the broker know what messages a subscriber is listening to:
```Java
broker.subscribe(new UnreadMessageReader(), UnreadMessage.class);
```
Example of how to send a message that subscribers can receive:
```Java
broker.publish("Hello world!");
```
Example application that counts to 100:
```Java
import com.joepritzel.feather.PSBroker;
import com.joepritzel.feather.PSBrokerBuilder;
import com.joepritzel.feather.Subscriber;

public class CountTo100 {

	private static PSBroker broker;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int countTo = 100;
		broker = new PSBrokerBuilder().build();
		broker.subscribe(new FinishedReader(), Finished.class);
		broker.subscribe(new Counter(countTo), Integer.class);
		broker.publish(0);
	}

	private static class Finished {
		public final int count;

		public Finished(int count) {
			this.count = count;
		}
	}

	private static class Counter extends Subscriber<Integer> {
		private final int max;

		public Counter(int max) {
			this.max = max;
		}

		@Override
		public void receive(Integer i) {
			if (i.intValue() == max) {
				broker.publish(new Finished(i.intValue()));
			} else {
				broker.publish(i + 1);
			}
		}
	}

	private static class FinishedReader extends Subscriber<Finished> {
		@Override
		public void receive(Finished f) {
			System.out.println("We finished at " + f.count);
		}
	}
}
```
